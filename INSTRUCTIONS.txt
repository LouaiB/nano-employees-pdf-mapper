1. Double click the "install" file and wait till the terminal window opens then closes.
2. Put the PDF files you want to rename into the "put-pdf-files-here" folder.
3. Double click the "run" file, then wait till the terminal stops showing new messages. Click Enter to close it.

The renamed PDF files are now in the "results" folder.

DO NOT delete the folders, even after finishing.
When starting a new batch, delete all the old PDF files from inside "put-pdf-files-here" and "results" if you had some in there from before.
